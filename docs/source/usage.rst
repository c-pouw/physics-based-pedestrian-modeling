Usage
=====

Start by importing Data-driven physics-based modeling of pedestrian dynamics.

.. code-block:: python

    import physped

    Then, you can create a model and run simulations.

    You can use your own pedestrian trajectory data set or use one of the built-in trajectory readers.

    .. autofunction:: physped.core.functions_to_discretize_grid.cast_trajectories_to_discrete_grid
